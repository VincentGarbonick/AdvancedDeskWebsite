	<p class="aboutBody">
		A long time ago I decided I would thrust myself into the world of electronics and software. I spent a lot of time building my skills and making my procjects and ideas come to life. 
	</p>
	<p class="aboutBody">
		I honed my skills at some of my first coops and continued to learn at home when I worked on side projects. 
	</p>
	<p class="aboutBody">
		Now I aim to make projects for fun. I also one day wish to become good enough at programming to make my own versions of paid software and distribute them for free. I also wouldn't mind making tutorials and guides for up and coming programmers, hackers, and makers as well.
	</p>
	<p class="aboutBody">
		I do a lot of things in my free time. I play bass in a band, camp outside, play board games, and work out. I love the outdoors and animals.

	<p class="DroidBody">Possibly the most important member of the Advanced_Desk team, Droid is the lifeblood of this LLC. She manages all important communications alongside fortifying the business pathways of our company.</p>

	<p class="DroidBody"> The biggest assets this amazing person brings to this company is her overall increase of synergy. Our buinsess would be much more inefficent and dour without such an effective motivator. If it were not for her, our stock prices would be in the toilet and our shareholders would be furious. 

	<p class="DroidBody">Have I used enough buzzwords yet?</p>
