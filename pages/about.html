        <p class="about-text">At the moment, I am trying to learn as much as I can. I rotate between Co-Op and classes 
        for my univsersity program. Sometimes I will do research or spearhead projects on the side
        if I have the free time. I try to spend as much time as possible learning as many software
        and hardware skills as possible to help me in the future.</p> 
        <p class="about-text">I am incredibly passionate about learning new things and growing as an engineer. I want to 
        some day be integral to the development of a company due to the work I do. I love engineering
        because it allows me to be constantly learning, and it allows me to work in teams of people. </p>
        <p class="about-text">It does my heart good to be able to go home and apply things I learned on the job to day 
        to day life. Coming home from my Co-Op and being able to set up a server and host a website
        because of learning HTML would be such an example.</p>
        <p class="about-text">I love music. I have been playing some kind of instrument since kindergarten and have always 
        been adding new instruments to my repitoire. I currently play 5 with bass and saxophone being 
        my main ones. </p>
        <p class="about-text">I am currently a student at the University of Akron. Send me an email if you are interested 
        in adding me to your team!</p>
